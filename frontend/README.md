# Frontend: Affiliate Network Dashboard

This is the Next.js frontend for your automated affiliate website network. It provides:
- Analytics dashboard (connects to FastAPI backend)
- Onboarding/setup page for API keys

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal in this directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
3. Use the onboarding page to enter your API keys (also paste them in config.env for now).

You can customize the UI and add more features as your network grows!
